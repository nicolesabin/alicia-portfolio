                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            Glim came out of a single package design project. I realized there is a lack of 
                            presence in the candle industry; not many have their own retail location. I wanted to 
                            fill this void.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-solution">
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            I came up with a candle brand, and furthered it into packaging and a retail 
                            space. This allowed for the defining of a look and feel for the identity, capturing its 
                            essence through all aspects.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-process">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            I defined the look and feel I wanted to create with the new logo as 
                            <strong>ethereal, elegant, and clean</strong>. The logotype is simple 
                            and clean with an airy feel, like wisps of smoke. I pulled in an accompanying serif to 
                            provide a touch of old-world elegance to the mark.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I aimed for a specific logo style for this project. While capturing the feel I 
                            wanted for the brand, I focused on a logotype-based solution. With a successful primary 
                            logo, secondary marks followed as I expanded the logo into a full branding identity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Initial iterations were too decorative; I pushed my comfort zone to use serif 
                            typeface for accompanying text instead of sans. After refinement, the typeface was too 
                            square, and the flame too much like a water drop. The final solution had close aesthetics; 
                            I enjoyed the dot that is barely a flame.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-result">
                        <h2>Result</h2>
                        <p>
                            With a successful logo configured, I expanded it into a full identity; this 
                            included packaging and integration into a retail location. I designed Glim to be a boutique 
                            shop in malls or outdoor strips, that focuses on candles and the experience of creating 
                            your own ambiance through them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I approached packaging with a unified look but subtle variances across different types 
                            of packaging. I specifically chose not to brand the flavors/scents but instead the 
                            product lines. This included hexagonal boxes containing hexagon-shaped wax melts, jars, 
                            tealight tins, and pillar candles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To get an idea of how the packaging could come together, I prototyped through vector 
                            illustrations. This helped me visualize how the packaging could actually exist, 
                            excluding limits of material. The packaging featured illustrative prototypes that captured 
                            the ethereal and elegant brand aesthetic.

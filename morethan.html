                        <p>
                            As designers, we have an opportunity to use our voice to spread awareness and 
                            advocate for causes we believe in. As a sufferer, I like to advocate for mental 
                            health awareness when I can, and think the world needs more of that.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-solution">
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            The solution was to come up with a project to use my voice to raise awareness. 
                            I created a mental health awareness campaign, centered around postage stamp 
                            designs. The thinking behind this is the use of the stamps would advocate for the 
                            issue, and the act of writing out messages and mailing is an act of self-care that 
                            makes both sender and recipient happy.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-process">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            I wanted to depict certain feelings that go along with mental health, specifically 
                            the inner turmoil one goes through. I represented broken, painful, and trapped 
                            thoughts. I chose to pair this dark imagery with muted rainbow hues, to show the idea 
                            of the whole spectrum of mental health – good and bad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A lot of my process involves word associations and mind-maps. I approached 
                            this project in a flat vector style. From that point, I sketched these mental 
                            health concepts, specifically choosing to be abstract. Those I felt successful with were 
                            taken to flat illustrations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Concepts explored included: unraveling self (coming undone), intrusive and painful thoughts, 
                            shattered and broken inside, caged and unspoken thoughts, and being suffocated or burdened 
                            by weight (heavy things don't fly).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I styled the campaign itself around the concept of mental health as well. I chose 
                            visual elements that combat with each other, but come together as a whole. A 
                            friendly typeface was chosen, paired with a disorderly texture.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-result">
                        <h2>Result</h2>
                        <p>
                            The campaign included a cohesive set of stamps and postcards, with two stamp sets: 
                            one with chaotic texture and type, and the other with iconic illustration. This allows for 
                            the literal feeling of mental illnesses to be visualized, as well as more abstract concepts 
                            that all people can relate to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To further the campaign into active use, it was pushed beyond just postage. 
                            Postcards, stationery, trading cards, and stamps are included in a commemorative 
                            box set to encourage users to collect the set and share it with others. Awareness is 
                            then spread through gifting and using the materials to send mail to others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal of this campaign was to promote mental health awareness and the act 
                            of self-care. This is achieved through the support of the campaign, and the 
                            use. Sending snail mail is a much more personal method of communication, that 
                            brings a sense of joy and good to both sender and recipient.
                        </p>

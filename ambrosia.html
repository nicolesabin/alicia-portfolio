                        <p>
                            Ambrosia was created as a juice bar that supports its local community. It needed to 
                            be branded with a full identity system that could be applied in a variety of ways.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-solution">
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            I reworked my design solution, revisiting some original concepts and making 
                            refinements to create a new identity: Ambrosia Juice Bar. I felt the name and 
                            concept lent itself to a juice bar retail setting, and this would allow me to branch 
                            into aspects of branding and identity.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-process">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            I wanted to refresh my own work and give it new life. I defined a market, a juice and 
                            smoothie retail location, and the look and feel I wanted to create with the new logo as 
                            <strong>bright, bold, and fun</strong>; the shapes are bold, the colors are bright, and the overall feel is 
                            modern but fun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I revisited this project, I went back to early iterations. I felt some of them 
                            had promise, and began expanding and reworking those. With a successful logo configured, 
                            I expanded it into a full identity system, including color palette, typography, graphic 
                            elements, and an icon set.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The icon set was a really exciting part of the brand I had in mind. I wanted to create 
                            a cohesive icon set that could then be used as graphic elements, wayfinding, and 
                            packaging design.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-result">
                        <h2>Result</h2>
                        <p>
                            The brand system worked across many different types of materials, internal and external. 
                            The icon set was used in a variety of ways including wayfinding systems, packaging design, 
                            and as graphic elements. The identity was applied to location signage, packaging, loyalty 
                            programs, and promotional materials, creating a cohesive brand experience throughout the 
                            customer journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used the icon set in a variety of ways, because I wanted it to really feel integrated 
                            in the identity. One of the ways I utilized it was as part of a wayfinding system that 
                            would occur inside the establishment, including directional sandwich boards and order process 
                            signage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another way I used the developed icon set was as patterning for packaging. It was 
                            important to utilize the icons in a variety of ways, so they felt embedded into the 
                            branding identity. This included pre-bottled juice blends, along with made-to-order 
                            juices and smoothies.
                        </p>

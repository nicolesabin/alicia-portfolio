                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            A skill I wanted to feature for myself was hand lettering. It's a relevant skill to have, 
                            and one that I don't see many embracing or implementing beyond aesthetics. It's 
                            trendy, but it can be appropriate under the right circumstances.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-solution">
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            I chose to apply this skill in the form of book covers. Through this medium, I show 
                            the relevance of lettering in the field of design. I chose classic book titles from 
                            Penguin Books, to re-imagine in this style.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-process">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            My process for this problem was a little different. I knew going into it I couldn't 
                            portray the same feel with each cover; the hand lettering would need to suit each 
                            individual story. I wanted to capture a timeless, vintage aesthetic through the 
                            color palette and simple patterning. My goal was to capture the classic era while 
                            maintaining a certain cohesiveness, but allow each cover to have its own lettering 
                            style, suited to the story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I wanted the hand lettering to be the focal point of each cover. I wanted to continue 
                            with the hand-drawn theme, so I combined sketches with vector renderings to create 
                            seamless patterns as the imagery. Books included: Black Beauty, The Secret Garden, 
                            and Don Quixote.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For Black Beauty, I wanted to show contrast between beauty and wildness; I especially 
                            wanted to turn this on its head by doing "Black" in the script instead of "Beauty". 
                            For The Secret Garden, I aimed for a feeling of the wild garden before being tamed; 
                            overgrown and tangled. For Don Quixote, I gave a mild nod to the time period of the 
                            story, with a tight configuration that is reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Knowing I wanted to use patterning as a background element that was textural 
                            in nature, I kept the lettering simple. I lettered in bold, thick strokes so that the 
                            titles would stand out from the patterns without competing.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-result">
                        <h2>Result</h2>
                        <p>
                            The final covers combined hand-lettered titles with illustrative patterns, each 
                            maintaining its own individuality while working as a cohesive set. I chose to keep 
                            the color schemes monochromatic. This helped tie them together as a set, while 
                            each maintained its own individuality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I designed these covers as a set for Penguin Books, who publish many of 
                            classics and special edition collections. The final piece was a set of collectable 
                            bookmarks to accompany each book in the boxset. Mimicking the individual covers, 
                            each contains a hand-lettered quote from the stories within.

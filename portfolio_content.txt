I’M ALICIA
My design philosophy is simple: create 
work that conveys the intended message 
through a visual system that grabs the 
audience’s attention and engages them to 
look further.
I solve design problems through concept 
and aesthetics, with aesthetics being 
secondary. A trendy design piece with no 
concept fails. I get to concept through 
word associations, mind-mapping, and 
mood boards. The mood board is where 
I combine concept with aesthetic value, 
defining the look and feel of a design.
I’m a detail-oriented designer. My design 
solutions are whimsical and playful, 
backed by strong hierarchy, typography, 
and alignments. Inspiration strikes me 
like lightning or bubbles like a daydream. 
I’m inspired by everything around me: 
a beautiful color palette, interesting 
structure, or the feeling of a grey rainy day.

PROBLEM
Glassnote began as a logo redesign 
project. Their existing logo is direct, but 
lacks connotative value. It acts more like a 
monogram or even an abbreviation.
SOLUTION
Glassnote is an existing record label, who 
boasts well-known clients and prestigious 
indie label awards. With this in mind, I 
brought more connotation to their logo, 
in a cleaner and more modern style. This 
redesign was then expanded to a full re-
brand, creating an identity and laying out a 
brand guide in which to implement it.

PROCESS
I defined the look and feel of the new logo 
as proud, bold, and clean. The shapes are 
bold, the lines are clean, and it is simple 
and modern. I pulled in the diamond 
element to represent glass and prestige. 
Glassnote boasts of several accolades, so I 
wanted to bring in an element of quality in 
addition to music and sound.

PROCESS + SOLUTION
My process was to get out any rough ideas 
first, and then begin refining. I quickly 
realized that my initial iterations didn’t 
meet the brand goals I had in mind. As I 
expanded, I returned to things that were 
working, to combine elements into a 
cohesive logo that had the appropriate feel 
for the brand. Secondary logos followed as 
I expanded into a full branding identity.

apply the redesigned logo across varying 
applications, so as to properly identify the 
company and fully brand it.

SECONDARY  
LOGOS
Glassnote’s secondary logos can 
be used in place of the primary 
logo, but should never occur 
simultaneously.
The stacked logo (A) should be 
used in cases where the logo 
needs to be displayed on a 
smaller scale or when a vertical 
format is more appropriate.
The icon (B) may be used alone 
in cases where Glassnote is 
already displayed in plain text, 
such as a profile picture for 
Twitter or Instagram.
Either wordmark (C) may be 
used in cases where only the 
logotype is necessary.
The primary logo is always the 
most preferred. The secondary 
logos are to be used when it is 
not feasible to use the primary,

Glassnote Records is an up-and-
coming record company. With 
accolades like “Best Indie Label” 
from Rolling Stone, “Label of the 
Y ear” at the A2IM Libera Awards, and 
the “#1 Independent Label” from 
Billboard, it was important to convey 
pride and quality in the logo.
The shapes are bold, the lines are 
clean, and it is simple and modern. 
The overall depiction is that of the

TYPOGRAPHY
For a simple, clean look, Glassnote’s 
logo makes use of a sans-serif 
typeface, using two weights.
An accompanying typeface has 
been chosen to use along with the 
logo, in accompanying text such as 
graphics and stationery. Gotham 
Rounded matches the logo’s style 
and provides weight variations for a 
wide array of usability.

PRIMARY  
LOGO
Glassnote’s primary logo is a simple, 
clean pictorial mark. It is composed 
of bold shapes, clean lines, and 
modern type. The diamond depicts 
both glass and high quality, while the 
radiating lines emulate soundwaves, 
or a record. The variation in weight in 
type furthers the depiction of glass, 
in contrast with the weightier ‘note.’
This is the primary logo and should 
be used in most cases for cohesion 
and consistency. When appropriate, 
other uses may be applicable, but 
the guidelines herein should always 
be followed.
5
A.

B.

COLOR USAGE
Color has been placed strategically 
and conceptually in Glassnote’s 
logo, and therefore should never be 
altered. The shades of grey represent 
sound emanating outward, with the 
diamond being a bright pop of color 
in the otherwise neutral palette.
Exceptions lie in instances where the 
logo needs to be printed in a single 
color, or needs contrast on busier 
backgrounds, by way of solid black 
and solid white options.
9
DO &  
DON’T
These rules are provided to maintain 
the integrity of the Glassnote brand.
Do not compromise the look of 
the logo or the consistency of the 
brand by altering, embellishing, or 
distorting the logos in any way. The 
elements should not be separated 
except in the logo variations 
provided herein.

BRAND GUIDE
The final component to this project was to 
lay out a brand guide, detailing how to put 
all of these elements together to use as a 
cohesive brand identity system.

COLOR  
PALETTE
Glassnote’s color palette has been 
designed around neutrals with a 
pop of color. Glassnote features 
music from all walks of life, and 
prides themselves as a top indie 
label. This pride and unique quality 
is represented with the diamond, 
furthered as the only spot of 
color in the logo, which has been 
accentuated with the accompanying 
color palette.
The palette has been selected to 
imitate the way color works in the 
logo. It is a neutral palette, with pops 
of color in the form of the blue of the 
diamond from the logo, as well as a 
contrasting orange.
glassnote / BRAND GUIDE18
glassnote / BRAND GUIDE22
PHOTO  
STYLE
The photographic style for Glassnote 
is clean, with bold colors and 
dynamic cropping.
In most cases, the logo to be used 
on photographs should be the single 
color or solid black and/or solid 
white options.
The primary logo may be used if 
the contrast between the logo and 
photograph is strong enough.
TIPS
01. Photos with shallow depths-of-
field work best.
02. Avoid images with busy 
backgrounds and too much detail.
03. A dark color layer overlayed 
on a photo improves contrast and 
increases legibiility.

GRAPHIC  
ELEMENTS
Glassnote’s logo is comprised of 
clean, bold shapes that may be 
rearranged and used as graphic 
elements in and of themselves.
The diamond is rearranged for a 
simple, geometric pattern or texutre. 
Indivdually, the shapes may be 
taken and used for simple graphic 
elements. The emanating sound 
waves on their own and scaled 
up dramatically, create a graphic 
element and texture as well.

BRAND IN  
ACTION
The use of Glassnote’s branding 
assets should mimic the qualities 
depicted in the logo: proud, bold, 
and clean.
Color is to be used boldly, with 
attention-grabbing spots of color, 
while type is used in an open,  
minimal manner. T ake care to 
maintain clean, negative space.
Glassnote is also hip and modern. 
Use the branding assets and graphic 
elements in bold, exciting ways, so 
long as the branding standards are 
upheld and maintained.

PROBLEM
As designers, we have an opportunity to 
use our voice to spread awareness and 
advocate for causes we believe in. As 
a sufferer, I like to advocate for mental 
health awareness when I can, and think the 
world needs more of that.
SOLUTION
The solution was to come up with a 
project to use my voice to raise awareness. 
I created a mental health awareness 
campaign, centered around postage stamp 
designs. The thinking behind this is the 
use of the stamps would advocate for the 
issue, and the act of writing out messages 
and mailing is an act of self-care that 
makes both sender and recipient happy.

PROCESS
I wanted to depict certain feelings that 
go along with mental health, specifically 
the inner turmoil one goes through. I 
represented broken, painful, and trapped 
thoughts. I chose to pair this dark imagery 
with muted rainbow hues, to show the idea 
of the whole spectrum of mental health – 
good and bad.
mood board
28 29/  #MORETHAN CAMPAIGN

PROCESS + SOLUTION
A lot of my process involves word 
associations and mind-maps. I approached 
this project in a flat vector style. With 
that in mind, I started with this mind-map 
process and honed in on words that spoke 
to me.
From that point, I sketched these mental 
health concepts, specifically choosing to be 
abstract. Those I felt successful with were 
taken to flat illustrations.
sketch built into simple, flat vector illustration
concepts: heaviness, consuming, shattered
concepts: behind a mask, unraveling, chaos
concepts: painful thoughts, unspoken 
thoughts, guarded self
30 31/  #MORETHAN CAMPAIGN

ILLUSTRATIONS
With the final illustrations, I showed 
concepts that are cohesive in theme and 
show the different facets of mental health. 
I kept them on the abstract side, so people 
can look into them and find their own 
meaning and something they relate to.
unraveling self, coming undone intrusive, painful thoughts shattered and broken insidecaged, unspoken thoughtssuffocating or burdened by weight, heavy things 
don’t fly
32 33/  #MORETHAN CAMPAIGN

INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN
I styled the campaign itself around the 
concept of mental health as well. I chose 
visual elements that combat with each 
other, but come together as a whole. A 
friendly typeface was chosen, paired with a 
disorderly texture.
#morethan elements: texture, graphic elements, color 
palette, & typography

34 35/  #MORETHAN CAMPAIGN

UNIFIED SET
With the illustrations, elements, and palette 
decided, I created a cohesive set of stamps 
and postcards. Two stamp sets were created: 
one with chaotic texture and type, and the 
other with iconic illustration. This allows for 
the literal feeling of mental illnesses to be 
visualized, as well as more abstract concepts 
that all people can relate to.
37

IN ACTION
The goal of this campaign was to promote 
mental health awareness and the act 
of self-care. This is achieved through 
the support of the campaign, and the 
use. Sending snail mail is a much more 
personal method of communication, that 
brings a sense of joy and good to both 
sender and recipient.
38 /  #MORETHAN CAMPAIGN

COMMEMORATIVE SET
To further the campaign into active use, 
it was pushed beyond just postage. 
Postcards, stationery, trading cards, and 
stamps are included in a commemorative 
box set to encourage users to collect the 
set and share it with others. Awareness is 
then spread through gifting and using the 
materials to send mail to others.

PROBLEM
Ambrosia was created as juice bar that 
supports its local community. It needed to 
be branded with a full identity system that 
could be applied in a variety of ways.
SOLUTION
I reworked my design solution, revisiting 
some original concepts and making 
refinements to create a new identity: 
Ambrosia Juice Bar. I felt the name and 
concept lent itself to a juice bar retail 
setting, and this would allow me to branch 
into aspects of branding and identity.

PROCESS + SOLUTION
I wanted to refresh my own work and give 
it new life. I defined a market, a juice and 
smoothie retail location, and the look and 
feel I wanted to create with the new logo as 
bright, bold, and fun; the shapes are bold, 
the colors are bright, and the overall feel is 
modern but fun.
When I revisited this project, I went back 
to early iterations. I felt some of them 
had promise, and began expanding and 
reworking those.

WAYFINDING
I used the icon set in a variety of ways, 
because I wanted it to really feel integrated 
in the identity. One of the ways I utilized 
it was as part of a wayfinding system that 
would occur inside the establishment.

PACKAGING
Another way I used the developed icon 
set was as patterning for packaging. It was 
important to utilize the icons in a variety 
of ways, so they felt embedded into the 
branding identity.

PROBLEM
A skill I wanted to feature for myself was 
hand lettering.  It’s a relevant skill to have, 
and one that I don’t see many embracing 
or implementing beyond aesthetics. It’s 
trendy, but it can be appropriate under the 
right circumstances.
SOLUTION
I chose to apply this skill in the form of 
book covers. Through this medium, I show 
the relevance of lettering in the field of 
design. I chose classic book titles from 
Penguin Books, to re-imagine in this style.

PROCESS
My process for this problem was a little 
different. I knew going into it I couldn’t 
portray the same feel with each cover; the 
hand lettering would need to suit each 
individual story. I wanted to capture a 
timeless, vintage aesthetic through the 
color palette and simple patterning. My 
goal was to capture the classic era while 
mantaining a certain cohesiveness, but 
allow each cover to have its own lettering 
style, suited to the story.
64 65/  BOOK BOXSET

PROCESS + SOLUTION
I wanted the hand lettering to be the focal 
point of each cover. I wanted to continue 
with the hand-drawn theme, so I combined 
sketches with vector renderings to create 
seamless patterns as the imagery.

contrast between beauty and wildness; I especially 
wanted to turn this on its head by doing “Black” in the 
script instead of “Beauty”
a feeling of the wild garden before being tamed; 
overgrown and tangled
a mild nod to the time period of the story, with a tight 
configuration that is reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts
LETTERING
Knowing I wanted to use patterning as 
a background element that was textural 
in nature, I kept the lettering simple. I 
lettered in bold, thick strokes so that the 
titles would stand out from the patterns 
without competing.

FINAL COVERS
Once the patterns were created, I 
combined them with the lettering to 
compose each book cover. I chose to keep 
the color schemes monochromatic. This 
helped tie them together as a set, while 
each maintained its own individuality.

COLLECTABLE BOOKMARKS
The final piece was a set of collectable 
bookmarks to accompany each book in the 
boxset. Mimicking the individual covers, 
each contains a hand-lettered quote from 
the stories within.

PROBLEM
Glim came out of a single package design 
project. I realized there is a lack of 
presence in the candle industry; not many 
have their own retail location. I wanted to 
fill this void.
SOLUTION
I came up with a candle brand, and 
furthered it into packaging and a retail 
space. This allowed for the defining of a 
look and feel for the identity, capturing its 
essence through all aspects.

PROCESS
I defined the look and feel I wanted to 
create with the new logo as ethereal, 
elegant, and clean. The logotype is simple 
and clean with an airy feel, like wisps of 
smoke. I pulled in an accompanying serif to 
provide a touch of old-world elegance to 
the mark.

PROCESS + SOLUTION
I aimed for a specific logo style for this 
project. I gravitate towards pictorial logo 
designs, so while capturing the feel I 
wanted for the brand, I focused on a 
logotype-based solution.
With a successful primary logo, secondary 
marks followed as I expanded the logo into 
a full branding identity.
primary logo
secondary logos
too decorative; push comfort zone, use serif 
typeface for accompanying text instead of sans
improvement; typeface too square, flame too much like 
a water drop
close aesthetics; enjoy the dot 
that is barely a flame

BEYOND THE LOGO
With a successful logo configured, I 
expanded it into a full identity; this 
included packaging and integration into a 
retail location.

LOCATION
I designed Glim to be a shop that I feel is 
lacking in the candle industry: a boutique 
location in malls or outdoor strips, that 
focuses on candles and the experience of 
creating your own ambiance through them.

PACKAGING
I approached packaging with a unified look 
but subtle variances across different types 
of packaging. I specifically chose not to 
brand the flavors/scents but instead the 
product lines.

PROTOTYPES + PHYSICAL
To get an idea of how the packaging could 
come together, I prototyped through vector 
illustrations. This helped me visualize 
how the packaging could actually exist, 
excluding limits of material.

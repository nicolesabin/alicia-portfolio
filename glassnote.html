                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            Glassnote began as a logo redesign project. Their existing logo is direct, but 
                            lacks connotative value. It acts more like a monogram or even an abbreviation.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-solution">
                        <h2>Solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            Glassnote is an existing record label, who boasts well-known clients and prestigious 
                            indie label awards. With this in mind, I brought more connotation to their logo, 
                            in a cleaner and more modern style. This redesign was then expanded to a full rebrand, 
                            creating an identity and laying out a brand guide in which to implement it.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-process">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            I defined the look and feel of the new logo as <strong>proud, bold, and clean</strong>. 
                            The shapes are bold, the lines are clean, and it is simple and modern. I pulled in the 
                            diamond element to represent glass and prestige. Glassnote boasts of several accolades, 
                            so I wanted to bring in an element of quality in addition to music and sound.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My process was to get out any rough ideas first, and then begin refining. I quickly 
                            realized that my initial iterations didn't meet the brand goals I had in mind. As I 
                            expanded, I returned to things that were working, to combine elements into a cohesive 
                            logo that had the appropriate feel for the brand. Secondary logos followed as I expanded 
                            into a full branding identity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Initial iterations were too expected and heavy, not modern enough. As I refined, I 
                            improved the tone and aesthetic, but music note imagery was too expected. I started 
                            revisiting the diamond idea, combining with elements from music note configuration that 
                            were working for the final solution.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-result">
                        <h2>Result</h2>
                        <p>
                            The final solution included a primary logo, secondary logos, a complete brand identity 
                            system with color palette, typography, graphic elements, and a comprehensive brand guide. 
                            The identity was expanded into a functional system that could be applied across various 
                            applications including stationery, social media, and marketing materials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond the logo, I expanded it into a full-fledged identity. This included stationery and 
                            accompanying brand guide. The identity was applied across varying applications to properly 
                            identify the company and fully brand it. The brand system featured a defined type treatment, 
                            color, and graphic elements to push the identity beyond just a logo.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final component was to lay out a brand guide, detailing how to put all of these elements 
                            together to use as a cohesive brand identity system. The guide included logo usage, color 
                            palette, typography specifications, graphic elements, and brand applications.
